# Arkansas Film & Actor Website

This project is a simple website that highlights films and actors with ties to Arkansas.
It was created as a Capstone 2 project to demonstrate planning, analysis/design, and implementation.

## Features

- Home page explaining the purpose of the site
- Films list page with a small curated sample of Arkansas-connected films
- Film detail pages with synopsis, runtime, genre, production info, and sample cast list
- Actors list page with a sample of Arkansas actors and actresses
- Actor detail pages with biography, quick facts, and a short filmography
- Cross-links between films and actors
- Placeholder for Google Analytics tracking
- Clean, simple styling using a single CSS file

## Technology

- HTML
- CSS
- (Optional) A small amount of JavaScript for future enhancements
- GitHub Pages for hosting
- Google Analytics (tracking code snippet provided as a placeholder)

## How to Run

1. Download the project files.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser to view the home page.
3. Click on **Films** or **Actors** in the navigation bar to explore the rest of the site.

## How to Deploy on GitHub Pages

1. Create a new GitHub repository.
2. Upload all of the project files to the repository (including `index.html` and `styles.css`).
3. In the repository, go to **Settings → Pages**.
4. Under **Source**, select `Deploy from a branch` and choose your `main` branch with the `/root` directory.
5. Save. After a short delay, GitHub Pages will give you a public URL for your site.

## Google Analytics

A placeholder Google Analytics snippet is included in `index.html` inside an HTML comment.
To enable tracking:

1. Create a GA4 property and get your Measurement ID (looks like `G-XXXXXXXXXX`).
2. Replace `G-XXXXXXXXXX` in the snippet with your ID.
3. Remove the HTML comment markers so the script runs.

## Data Sources

This project is for demonstration and learning purposes only.
Typical data sources for a more complete version of the site would include:

- Encyclopedia of Arkansas
- IMDb
